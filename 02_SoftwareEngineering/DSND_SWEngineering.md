# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree: Introduction

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

The Nanodegree asssumes basic data analysis skills with python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.) and has 5 modules that build up on those skills:

1. Introduction to Data Science
2. Software Engineering
3. Data Engineering
4. Experimental Design & Recommendations
5. Data Scientist Capstone

This folder & guide refer to the **second module**: Software Engineering.
